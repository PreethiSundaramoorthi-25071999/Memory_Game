1.Create a basic structure for you games using the HTML tags like div, heading  
with the particular Classes and Ids associated with each one of them.

2.Now, select the elements with the help of class and id CSS selectors to style the elements and make 
the UI attractive and interactive.

3.After HTML and CSS, its time to get all the required elements inside the JavaScript 
code and apply logic on them.

4.In the next part, a callback function will be created to handle the click event of the cards. 
This function will handle the card flips whether the flipped card is same or different by 
removing and ading the classes to the elements.

5.Next, another callback function will be created to handle the Restart Game button click,
it will shuffle all the cards and flip them backward again to restart the game.

6.At the end, we will check for the condition where game ends and show the result
to the user by using the alert method of JavaScript.
